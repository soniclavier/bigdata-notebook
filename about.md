I am a Data Engineer with 6 years of experience in designing and building scalable and efficient systems and proficient in most of the BigData stacks. My current interests include Funcitonal Programming, Reactive Programming, Distributed Systems, Real-time Processing and Deep Learning.<br/><br/>
Welcome to my blog where I hope to share my knowledge in the field of Bigdata and Machine learning. I believe any topic if understood properly can be explained in simple terms, and I intend to do so through this blog.<br/><br/>
