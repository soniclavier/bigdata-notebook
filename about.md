<h1><b>Vishnu Viswanath</b></h1>
I am a competent Big Data developer currently pursuing MS in Computer Science with concentration in Data Analytics. I have over 4.5 years of experience in designing and building various scalable and efficient systems and proficient in most of the BigData stacks.<br/><br/>
	I am a relentless tech-enthusiast and like to keep myself up-to-date with the technologies in vogue. In these times of ever expanding three dimensional data, with my relevant experience and expertise and zeal for acquiring new skills and information, I hope to venture deeper in addressing the challenges posed in big data and machine learning which can further help me to master the domain of future analytic and computing models.
